To extract the executables and store them in their proper local (/usr/local/bin), 
just type:

	tar xvzPf datcom_bin.tz

If you don't have access to /usr/local/bin or don't have the root password, 
you will have to extract these files with:

	tar xvzpf datcom_bin.tz

(note the lower case "p"), which will extract these files to your local directory, 
in /usr/local/bin, and you will have to put these files somewhere in your path.
