*   List of Command Card
************************
*
*   Note : Command cards MUST start in column 1. They may appear in
*          any order, with the exception of NEXT CASE.
*
* NAMELIST  The contents of each applicatble namelist is dumped for the
*           case in the input system of units. (Very useful to see 
*           input parameter values).
* SAVE      Preserve the input data for the case to be used in the following 
*           cases. This would be useful if multiple or comparison cases
*           are built.
* DIM FT    Sets the system units of measure. Options are FT, IN, M, CM
* NEXT CASE Terminates the reading of input cards and begins execution of
*           the case. Case data are destroyed following execution of a case,
*           unless the SAVE card is present.
* TRIM      Trim calculations will be performed for each subsonic Mach number 
*           within the case. A vehicle may be trimmed by deflecting a control
*           device on the wing or horizontal tail or by deflecting an 
*           all-moveable horizontal stabilizer.
* DAMP      Provides dynamic-derivative results in addition to the standard
*           static-derivative output
* CASEID    Provides a case identification that is printed as part of the
*           output header.
* DUMP ALL  Prints the contents of the named arrays in the foot-pound-second
*           system. See Appendix C for list of arrays and their contents.
* DUMP CASE will print all the arrays that are used during case
*           execution prior to the conventional output. (Not particularily
*           useful, as all data is in nasty arrays)
* DUMP INPT will print dump of all input data blocks used for the case.
*           (also not useful)
* DUMP IOM  will print all the output arrays for the case. (not useful)
* DUMP ALL  will print all program arrays, even if not used for the case.
*           (surprisingly, not useful)
* DERIV DEG Defines the output units of measure for the static and dynamic
*           stability derivatives, either RAD or DEG. The following parameters
*           are affected: CLa, Cma, Cyb, Cnb, Clb, CLq, Cmq, Clp, Cyp, Cnp,
*           Cnr, Clr, CLad, CMad. JSBSim XML output is also switched between 
*           degrees and radians for alpha, beta, etc.
* PART      Provides auxiliary and partial outputs at each Mach number in the
*           case. These outputs are automatically provided for all cases at
*           transonic Mach numbers.
* BUILD     This command provides configuration build-up data. Conventional
*           static and dynamic stability data are output for a LOT of items.
* PLOT      Causes data generated by the program to be written to logical 
*           unit 13, which can be retained for input to the Plot Module.
*           (Looks like it dumps the data arrays out in column format. Not
*           too useful).
